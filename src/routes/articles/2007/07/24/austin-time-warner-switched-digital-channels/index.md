For the past few weeks I've been considering a Series 3 Tivo (and now the new [Tivo HD](http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/23/tivo-hd-dvr-is-the-newest-series3-tivotogo-coming-back/)) but Austin has switched digital and I could not find a list of channels I could not receive without a 2-way cable card.

[Here is the list](http://dmihalik.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/austin_switched_digital.pdf) I got from Time Warner today. The list was a lot longer than I expected. Hopefully Google will pick this up and it will help others in the same situation.
