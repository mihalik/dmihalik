title: 'Alt-Tab replacement'

![desktop-1.jpg](/images/desktop-1.jpg)I've always hated how Windows does Alt-Tab. Especially if I have multiple windows of the same application. You have to tab through each thing to get the title of the application. Usually I have to tab through twice because I miss what I'm looking for. That ends up wasting the time I did Alt-Tab to save.

I really liked how Ctrl-Tab works with some plugins in Firefox and also [Witch](http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?thema=witch&sprache=deutsch&kopf=labor) for OS X. I looked for a long time for Alt-Tab replacements. Almost everything I saw was similar to the standard Alt-Tab except it added thumbnails when you tabbed to something. That might look kinda cool, but it's pretty useless since I know what my windows look like.

So I decided to create my own Alt-Tab replacement that actually shows the items as a list with all the window titles. I've still got a couple bugs to work out, but I think it's looking pretty nice.
