I'm sure it'll never be released here in the US, but [this French site](http://akiba.sorobangeeks.com/) has some pictures and descriptions of something I've been hoping to see for a while; a USB hard drive with video capabilities. It's the [Mobile MediaGate (MG-25)](http://akiba.sorobangeeks.com/news_8431.html). It looks like a regular USB hard drive but it can play Divx, mpeg, ogg, mp3, aac, and wma. I know there are the new portable media centers coming out, but I don't see myself watching something on the small screen with limited battery, but I could see using this as a normal hard drive and plugging it into my entertainment system if I wanted to watch something or listen to MP3's.
