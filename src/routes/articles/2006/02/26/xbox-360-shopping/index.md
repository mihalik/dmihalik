Since it's less than a month till [Oblivion](http://www.elderscrolls.com/games/oblivion_overview.htm) is available (still March 21th), Jessie and I decided it's about time to start looking for a 360. I'm hoping that by waiting a while after launch I avoid some of the problems I had with the Xbox I got at launch time.

I'd like to buy my 360 from Best Buy since I have their Reward Zone program (or somewhere online without tax). I could call the store every day to see if they get any in, but I'm lazy. So, I downloaded and setup the [BestBuy Xbox 360 Inventory Checker](http://untitlednet.com/) that will hopefully email me and send me a text message when one is available. So far it looks pretty cool. To hedge my bets I've also been monitoring the [Xbox 360 Tracker](http://xbox360tracker.com/). Hopefully one of those methods will find us a 360 in the next 20 days.
