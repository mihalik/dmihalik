I made a few modifications to the design of the site. It's got the white background and big fonts that all the "Web 2.0" kids are doing these days. Plus I used one of my photos as a header. Take that, [iWeb](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/). I'll be doing a couple more things over the next few days, but overall I like this new design.
