I am a software engineer at [Indeed](http://indeed.com) in Austin, TX. This blog is a place for me to write about whatever I feel like. This might include:

- .NET programming
- Python/Django
- Home theater equipment
- Digital media
- Video games
- Board games
- And other random crap

I don't generally talk about work on my blog, and the views expressed on this blog are my own and don't represent the views of my employer.
