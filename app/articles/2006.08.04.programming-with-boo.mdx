I've spent a few nights playing with a new (to me) programming language, [Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org). It really feels like the best of C#, Ruby, and Python. If you are interested in writing for the CLI or you are generally interested in programming languages, check out the [features page](http://boo.codehaus.org/Language+Features) to check out some of the reasons why I've been impressed.

If you are interested in trying it out, be sure and grab the new version of [SharpDevelop](http://sharpdevelop.com/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx). It's got built-in support for Boo projects (including Windows Forms editing).
