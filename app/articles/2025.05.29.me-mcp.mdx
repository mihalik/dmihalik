I updated my `/contact` page today with a new way to contact me, [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP). This allows you to use AI tools to discover some information from my resume and contact me directly.

I have open sourced this project at [me-mcp](https://github.com/mihalik/me-mcp). This was a fun way to play around with MCP and host a publicly available MCP server.
